Latex and simulation scripts for the paper:

R. G. McKilliam, Barry G. Quinn, I. V. L. Clarkson, and Bill Moran. Frequency estimation by phase unwrapping. IEEE Trans. Signal Process., 58(6):2953-2963, June 2010.

Simulation data already exists in this repository (the same data as used in the paper).  If you are using bash then

sh buildfigsandpdf.sh

will build the pdf using this data.  The output pdf is called lsuwrapping.pdf.  If you want to run all the simulations again use

sh runsimsandbuildeverything.sh

You need a working java jvm and also Scala 2.8 or higher installed.  Depending on your machine this might take a while.  Probably a day or so because the least squares unwrapping estimator is quite slow.  Open up the bash script and work backwards to get at code.
