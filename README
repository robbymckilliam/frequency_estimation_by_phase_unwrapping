Latex and simulation scripts for the paper:

R. G. McKilliam, Barry G. Quinn, I. V. L. Clarkson, and Bill Moran. Frequency estimation by phase unwrapping. IEEE Trans. Signal Process., 58(6):2953-2963, June 2010.

Simulation data already exists in this repository (the same data as used in the paper).  If you are using bash then

bash build.sh

will build the pdf using this data.  The output pdf is called lsuwrapping.pdf.  The code/ directory contains the source code and simulation scripts.

bash runsim.sh

will run the simulations and regenerate data for the paper.  You need a working java jvm and also Scala 2.10.x or higher installed.  Depending on your machine this might take a while.  Probably a day or so because the least squares unwrapping estimator is quite slow.  Open up the bash script and work backwards to get at the code.
