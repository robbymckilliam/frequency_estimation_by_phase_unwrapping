The decoder is based on a bounded distance search among the lattice points falling inside a sphere centered at the received point.

	volume = {48},
issn = {1053-587X},
doi = {10.1109/78.839999},
abstract = {A novel method for signal parameter estimation is presented, termed the nonlinear instantaneous least squares (NILS) estimator. The basic idea is to use the observations in a sliding window to compute an instantaneous (short-term) estimate of the amplitude used in the separated nonlinear least squares (NLLS) criterion. The effect is a significant improvement of the numerical properties in the criterion function, which becomes well-suited for a signal parameter search. For small-sized sliding windows, the global minimum in the NLIS criterion function is wide and becomes easy to find. For maximum size windows, the NILS is equivalent to the NLLS estimator, which implies statistical efficiency for Gaussian noise. A blind signal parameter search algorithm that does not use any a priori information is proposed. The NILS estimator can be interpreted as a signal-subspace projection-based algorithm. Moreover, the NILS estimator can be interpreted as an estimator based on the prediction error of a (structured) linear predictor. Hereby, a link is established between NLLS, signal-subspace fitting, and linear prediction-based estimation approaches. The NILS approach is primarily applicable to deterministic signal models. Specifically, polynomial-phase signals are studied, and the NILS approach is evaluated and compared with other approaches. Simulations show that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold is significantly lower than that of the other methods, and it is confirmed that the estimates are statistically efficient. Just as the NLLS approach, the NILS estimator can be applied to nonuniformly sampled data },

An elegant algorithm is given for the Voronoi reduction of a three-dimensional lattice, leading to a new proof of Voronoi's theorem that every lattice of dimension n ≤ 3 is of the first kind, and of Fedorov's classification of the three-dimensional lattices into five types. There is a very simple formula for the determinant of a three-dimensional lattice in terms of its conorms.},

Several closely related estimators are proposed whose main characteristics are simplicity, accuracy, and ease of online or offline implementation.

It should be easy to extend this approach to signals having polynomials of any degree in the exponent.

abstract={We address an open question, regarding whether a lattice code with lattice decoding (as opposed to maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding) can achieve the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel capacity. We first demonstrate how minimum mean-square error (MMSE) scaling along with dithering (lattice randomization) techniques can transform the power-constrained AWGN channel into a modulo-lattice additive noise channel, whose effective noise is reduced by a factor of √(1+SNR/SNR). For the resulting channel, a uniform input maximizes mutual information, which in the limit of large lattice dimension becomes 1/2 log (1+SNR), i.e., the full capacity of the original power constrained AWGN channel. We then show that capacity may also be achieved using nested lattice codes, the coarse lattice serving for shaping via the modulo-lattice transformation, the fine lattice for channel coding. We show that such pairs exist for any desired nesting ratio, i.e., for any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, for the modulo-lattice additive noise channel lattice decoding is optimal. Finally, we show that the error exponent of the proposed scheme is lower bounded by the Poltyrev exponent.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of multiple wideband
	polynomial-phase signal {(PPS)} sources in sensor arrays. A new maximum
	likelihood {(ML)} direction-of-arrival {(DOA)} estimator is introduced,
	and the exact {Cramer-Rao} bound {(CRB)} is derived for the general
	case of multiple constant-amplitude polynomial-phase sources. Since
	the proposed exact {ML} estimator is computationally intensive, an
	approximate solution is proposed, originating from the analysis of
	the log-likelihood {(LL)} function in the single chirp signal case.
	As a result, a new form of spatio-temporal matched filter (referred
	to as the chirp beamformer) is derived, which is applicable to "well-separated"
	sources that have distinct time-frequency or/and spatial signatures.
	This beamforming approach requires solving a three-dimensional {(3-D)}
	optimization problem and, therefore, enjoys essentially simpler implementation
	than that entailed by the exact {ML.} Simulation results are presented,
	illustrating the performance of the estimators and validating our
	theoretical {CRB} analysis},

abstract={ Sphere decoding has been suggested by a number of authors as an efficient algorithm to solve various detection problems in digital communications. In some cases, the algorithm is referred to as an algorithm of polynomial complexity without clearly specifying what assumptions are made about the problem structure. Another claim is that although worst-case complexity is exponential, the expected complexity of the algorithm is polynomial. Herein, we study the expected complexity where the problem size is defined to be the number of symbols jointly detected, and our main result is that the expected complexity is exponential for fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrary to previous claims. The sphere radius, which is a parameter of the algorithm, must be chosen to ensure a nonvanishing probability of solving the detection problem. This causes the exponential complexity since the squared radius must grow linearly with problem size. The rate of linear increase is, however, dependent on the noise variance, and thus, the rate of the exponential function is strongly dependent on the SNR. Therefore sphere decoding can be efficient for some SNR and problems of moderate size, even though the number of operations required by the algorithm strictly speaking always grows as an exponential function of the problem size.},

abstract={ In multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD) for power-efficient transmission over Rayleigh fading channels without channel state information, blocks of N received symbols are jointly processed to decide on N-1 data symbols. The search space for the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate is therefore (complex) (N-1)-dimensional, and maximum-likelihood MSDD (ML-MSDD) quickly becomes computationally intractable as N grows. Mackenthun's low-complexity MSDD algorithm finds the ML estimate only for Rayleigh fading channels that are time-invariant over an N symbol period. For the general time-varying fading case, however, low-complexity ML-MSDD is an unsolved problem. In this letter, we solve this problem by applying sphere decoding (SD) to ML-MSDD for time-varying Rayleigh fading channels. The resulting technique is referred to as multiple-symbol differential sphere decoding (MSDSD).},

abstract={Estimating the parameters of a cisoid with an unknown amplitude and polynomial phase using uniformly spaced samples can result in ambiguous estimates due to Nyquist sampling limitations. It has been shown previously that nonuniform sampling has the advantage of unambiguous estimates beyond the Nyquist frequency; however, the effect of sampling on the Cramer-Rao bounds is not well known. This paper first derives the maximum likelihood estimators and Cramer-Rao bounds for the parameters with known, arbitrary sampling times. It then outlines two methods for incorporating random sampling times into the lower variance bounds, describing one in detail. It is then shown that for a signal with additive white Gaussian noise the bounds for the estimation with nonuniform sampling tend toward those of uniform sampling. Thus, nonuniform sampling overcomes the ambiguity problems of uniform sampling without incurring the penalty of an increased variance in parameter estimation},

These estimators are closely related to IF estimation via the (periodic) first moment, with respect to frequency of discrete time-frequency representations (TFRs) in L. Cohen's (1966) class. The authors determine the distribution of this class of estimators and establish a framework which allows the comparison of several other estimators such as the zero-crossing estimator and one based on linear regression on the signal phase. It is found that the regression IF estimator is biased and exhibits a large threshold for much of the frequency range. By replacing the linear convolution operation in the regression estimator with the appropriate convolution operation for circular data the authors obtain the parabolic SCFD (PSCFD) estimator, which is unbiased and has a frequency-independent variance, yet retains the optimal performance and simplicity of the original estimator},

Within the past two decades, various new techniques have appeared, mostly to meet the needs of scientific workers dealing with directional data. The paper first introduces the two basic models for the multi-dimensional case known as the von Mises-Fisher distribution and the Bingham distribution. Their sampling distribution theory depends heavily on the isotropic case and some developments are discussed. An optimum property of an important test for the von Mises-Fisher case is established. A nonparametric test is proposed for the hypothesis of independence for observations on a torus. In addition to some numerical examples on the preceding topics, five case studies are given which illuminate the power of this new methodology. The case studies are concerned with cancer research, origins of comets, arrival times of patients, navigational problems and biological rhythms. Some unsolved problems are also indicated.},

Traditional methods for the exact evaluation of SbSSDMs involve exponential complexity in the sequence length. A class of problems is identified for which the SbSSDMs can be exactly evaluated with only polynomial complexity with respect to the sequence length. Utilizing the close connection between symbol-by-symbol and sequence detection, it is also shown that for the aforementioned class of problems, detection of an uncoded data sequence in the presence of unknown parameters can be performed with polynomial complexity. The applicability of this technique is demonstrated by considering the problem of iterative detection of low-density parity-check codes in the presence of unknown and time-varying carrier-phase offset.

Our detector is based on a new approximation we propose to the noncoherent ML function. We show that by using this close approximation, the detection problem reduces to a nearest lattice point problem for the lattice An*, from which we derive our O(T) approach.

abstract={ Single frequency estimation is a long-studied problem with application domains including radar, sonar, telecommunications, astronomy and medicine. One method of estimation, called phase unwrapping, attempts to estimate the frequency by performing linear regression on the phase of the received signal. This procedure is complicated by the fact that the received phase is `wrapped' modulo $2pi$ and therefore must be `unwrapped' before the regression can be performed. In this paper, we propose an estimator that performs phase unwrapping in the least squares sense. The estimator is shown to be strongly consistent and its asymptotic distribution is derived. We then show that the problem of computing the least squares phase unwrapping is related to a problem in algorithmic number theory known as the nearest lattice point problem. We derive a polynomial time algorithm that computes the least squares estimator. The results of various simulations are described for different values of sample size and SNR.},

	higher firing rates also elicited a higher reliability of LFP phase
	across trials. To establish whether the LFP phase at which spikes
	were emitted conveyed visual information that could not be extracted
	by spike rates alone, we compared the Shannon information about the
	movie carried by spike counts to that carried by the phase of firing.
	We found that at low LFP frequencies, the phase of firing conveyed
	54\% additional information beyond that conveyed by spike counts.
	The extra information available in the phase of firing was crucial
	for the disambiguation between stimuli eliciting high spike rates
	of similar magnitude. Thus, phase coding may allow primary cortical
	neurons to represent several effective stimuli in an easily decodable
	format.}

We present conditions for obtaining cosistency and asymptotic normality of a very general class of estimators (extremum estimators). Consistent asymptotic variance estimators are given to enable approximation of the asymptotic distribution. Asymptotic efficiency is another desirable property then considered. Throughout the chapter, the general results are also specialized to common econometric estimators (e.g. MLE and GMM), and in specific examples we work through the conditions for the various results in detail. The results are also extended to two-step estimators (with finite-dimensional parameter estimation in the first step), estimators derived from nonsmooth objective functions, and semiparametric two-step estimators (with nonparametric estimation of an infinite-dimensional parameter in the first step). Finally, the trinity of test statistics is considered within the quite general setting of GMM estimation, and numerous examples are given.},

	The maximum value C<sub>&infin;</sub> such that, for any NLD less

	by means of a random coding method and it is very similar to the
	usual random coding bound for the AWGN channel. The exponents of
	these upper and lower bounds coincide for high values of the NLD,
	thereby enabling derivation of the generalized capacity of the AWGN
	channel without restrictions. It is also shown that the exponent

abstract = {Kay has proposed a technique for estimating the frequency of a complex sinusoid in additive noise, the real and imaginary parts of which are independent and normally distributed with means zero and the same variance. For fixed sample size the estimator achieves the Cramer2013Rao lower bound for unbiased estimators of the frequency in the limit as the signal to noise ratio approaches infinity. It has been noted by Lovell and Williamson, however, that the estimator is biased. It is shown in this paper that under Kay's assumptions the estimator is not consistent (for fixed signal to noise ratio the estimator converges almost surely, as the sample size N increases, to a number that is not the true frequency, no matter how large the signal to noise ratio). A class of distributions for the additive noise is proposed under which the technique is strongly consistent and has the correct order of asymptotic variance, namely N22123, for the case where there is some a priori knowledge concerning the range of the frequency. For this class a normal central limit theorem is developed.}

	concurrently with the coefficient estimation. The unwrapping performance
	is improved because of the use of current coefficient estimates.
	A secondary result provided by the new algorithm is an instantaneous

abstract={ It is well known that the Euclidean algorithm or its equivalent, continued fractions, can be used to find the error locator polynomial and the error evaluator polynomial in Berlekamp's key equation that is needed to decode a Reed-Solomon (RS) code. In the paper, a simplified procedure is developed and proved to correct erasures as well as errors by replacing the initial condition of the Euclidean algorithm by the erasure locator polynomial and the Forney syndrome polynomial. By this means, the errata locator polynomial and the errata evaluator polynomial can be obtained simultaneously and simply, by the Euclidean algorithm only. With this improved technique, the complexity of time-domain Reed-Solomon decoders for correcting both errors and erasures is reduced substantially from previous approaches. As a consequence, decoders for correcting both errors and erasures of RS codes can be made more modular, regular, simple, and naturally suitable for both VLSI and software implementation. An example illustrating this modified decoding procedure is given for a (15, 9) RS code.},

abstract={ Trellis-coded modulation schemes using four-, eight-, or16-dimensional constellations have a number of potential advantages over the usual two-dimensional schemes: a smaller constituent two-dimensional constellation, easier tolerance to phase ambiguities, and a better trade-off between complexity and coding gain. A number of such schemes are presented and evaluated. Starting with a variety of multidimensional lattices, we show how to select multidimensional constellations, how to partition them into subsets, how to construct trellis codes using those subsets, and how to map hits to constellation points. Simplifications of the Viterbi decoding algorithm are presented. We conclude that there are multidimensional trellis-coded modulation schemes that perform better for the same complexity than do two-dimensional schemes.},

abstract={We address the parameter estimation problem for a class of nonstationary signals modeled as polynomial phase signals with time-varying amplitudes. Exponentially damped polynomial phase signals are treated as a special case and are analyzed in detail. High-order instantaneous moments provide the basic analytical tool, but links are shown to exist with either the usually employed FFT-based technique or the high-resolution Kumaresan-Tufts (1982), MUSIC, and matrix pencil methods. Asymptotic properties of the relevant estimators are established, Cramer-Rao lower bounds on the amplitude and phase parameter estimates are derived, and computer simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of various schemes. We focus on parametric modeling of AM-FM signals, mainly because parametric techniques offer parsimony and allow for theoretically unlimited resolution},
